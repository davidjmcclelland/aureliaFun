[History](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/videos/aurelia-for-beginners/9781789139754/9781789139754-video2_15) note the instructor chose to use the same pages as in routing, but put them in a different directory. This muddies the water about the fact that history works on the routed pages you set up in a router. I used the same pages as in the previous lesson, and history works with the router just fine.
